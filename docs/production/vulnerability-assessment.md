# Vulnerability Assessment
{: .no_toc }


Vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying and quantifying security vulnerabilities in an organization's IT systems, applications, and infrastructure. The goal of vulnerability assessment is to provide organizations with a comprehensive view of their security posture, allowing them to identify and prioritize security risks and take steps to remediate them.

In the context of DevSecOps, vulnerability assessment is a critical component of a comprehensive security strategy. By regularly scanning for vulnerabilities and identifying potential security risks, organizations can take proactive steps to secure their applications and infrastructure.

Some of the key benefits of vulnerability assessment in DevSecOps include:

1. Early detection of vulnerabilities: By regularly scanning for vulnerabilities, organizations can detect potential security risks early on, allowing them to take swift action to remediate them.

2. Improved risk management: Vulnerability assessments provide organizations with a comprehensive view of their security posture, allowing them to identify and prioritize security risks and take steps to mitigate them.

3. Compliance: Many regulatory requirements, such as PCI DSS and HIPAA, require regular vulnerability assessments as part of their compliance standards.

4. Integration with other DevSecOps practices: Vulnerability assessment can be integrated with other DevSecOps practices, such as continuous integration and continuous deployment, to ensure that security is built into the application development lifecycle.

There are a variety of vulnerability assessment tools and technologies available that can be used in DevSecOps, including both commercial and open-source solutions. Some popular vulnerability assessment tools include Nessus, Qualys, and OpenVAS.


Best practices for vulnerability assessment:

1. Conduct regular vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses and misconfigurations in your network and infrastructure.
2. Use a combination of automated and manual vulnerability scanning techniques to ensure comprehensive coverage.
3. Prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact on your organization.
4. Regularly update and patch software and systems to address known vulnerabilities.
5. Use segmentation and isolation to limit the spread of attacks in case of a successful breach.



## Nessus

A vulnerability scanner that allows you to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in your network and infrastructure.	


```
nessuscli scan new -n "My Scan" -t "192.168.1.0/24" -T "Basic Network Scan"
```

## OpenVAS

An open-source vulnerability scanner that allows you to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in your network and infrastructure.	

```
omp -u admin -w password -h localhost -p 9390 -G
```

## Nmap

A network exploration and vulnerability scanner that allows you to identify open ports and potential vulnerabilities in your network.	


```
nmap -sS -A -p1-65535 target.com
```

## Qualys

A cloud-based vulnerability management platform that allows you to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in your network and infrastructure.	

```
curl -H 'X-Requested-With: Curl Sample' -u "USERNAME:PASSWORD" -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://qualysapi.qualys.com/api/2.0/fo/scan/?action=launch&scan_title=NewScan&target=TARGET_IP&option_profile=PROFILE_ID'
