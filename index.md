Welcome to DevSecOpsGuides, a comprehensive resource for developers, security professionals, and operations teams who want to learn about the world of DevSecOps.

3. Security testing: Learn about different types of security testing, such as penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and code review, and how to incorporate them into your DevSecOps workflow.

4. Infrastructure security: Learn about securing the infrastructure that supports your applications, including servers, networks, and databases.

5. Compliance and regulations: Learn about compliance requirements and regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, and how to ensure that your applications meet these standards.
